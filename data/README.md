# Popup Stores SQLite Database Generator

This directory contains the SQLite database generator for **Zava Popup Stores**, a fictional retail company with popup locations across the US. The generator creates a comprehensive sales database with realistic retail data patterns, seasonal variations, and advanced features for data analysis and agentic applications.

## Quick Start

### How to Generate the Popup Stores SQLite Database

To generate the complete Popup Stores SQLite database:

```bash
# Run the generator (creates complete database)
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator

# Or run with specific options
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --show-stats          # Show database statistics
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --embeddings-only     # Populate embeddings only
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --verify-embeddings   # Verify embeddings table
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --verify-seasonal     # Verify seasonal patterns
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --clear-embeddings    # Clear existing embeddings
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --batch-size 200      # Set embedding batch size
uv run python -m zava_shop_datagenerator --num-customers 100000 # Set number of customers

## Key Data Features

### 📊 Seasonal Variations

The generator implements **multi-zone seasonal multipliers** across three climate zones for realistic business patterns:

#### **🌲 Pacific Northwest Zone** (Seattle, Portland)
- **Outerwear**: Peak winter demand (1.8x), low summer (0.6x)
- **Apparel - Tops**: Summer peak (1.4x), winter low (0.6x)
- **Pattern**: Mild, wet winters and dry summers

#### **🌡️ Temperate Zone** (NYC, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Nashville, Minneapolis, Raleigh, Salt Lake City)
- **Outerwear**: Strong winter pattern (1.6x), minimal summer (0.5x)
- **Apparel - Tops**: Summer focused (1.3x), winter low (0.7x)
- **Pattern**: Moderate seasonal variation with distinct seasons

#### **☀️ Warm Zone** (SF, Austin, Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix)
- **Outerwear**: Mild winter demand (1.3x), very low summer (0.4x)
- **Apparel - Tops**: Strong summer demand (1.4x)
- **Pattern**: Milder winters, hot summers

#### **Seasonal Business Intelligence**
- **Outerwear** shows strongest seasonal variation (0.4x to 1.8x multipliers)
- **Apparel - Bottoms** maintain stable year-round demand
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec)** universally strong for outerwear and accessories

### 💰 Financial Structure

## JSON Data File Schemas

The generator requires two JSON configuration files that define the product catalog and store configurations:

### `reference_data/product_data.json` Schema

Defines the complete product catalog with embeddings and seasonal patterns:

```json
{
  "main_categories": {
    "<CATEGORY_NAME>": {
      "<PRODUCT_TYPE>": [
        {
          "name": "string",                    // Product display name
          "sku": "string",                     // Unique product identifier
          "price": number,                     // Base cost price
          "description": "string",             // Product description
          "stock_level": number,               // Base inventory level
          "image_path": "string",              // Relative path to product image
          "image_embedding": [float, ...],     // 512-dimension image vector embedding
          "description_embedding": [float, ...] // 1536-dimension text vector embedding
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **`image_embedding`: Serialized embedding array for image similarity search
- **`description_embedding`**: Serialized embedding array for text similarity search
- `price`: The actual retail store selling price; cost is calculated backwards using 33% gross margin (Cost = Price × 0.67)
- Each category can contain multiple product types, each with an array of products
- Seasonal multipliers are now defined separately in `seasonal_multipliers.json`

### `reference_data/stores_reference.json` Schema

Defines store configurations and business rules:

```json
{
  "stores": {
    "<STORE_NAME>": {
      "rls_user_id": "uuid",                  // Row Level Security identifier
      "customer_distribution_weight": number, // Relative customer allocation weight
      "order_frequency_multiplier": number,   // Order frequency scaling factor
      "order_value_multiplier": number        // Order value scaling factor
    }
  },
  "year_weights": {
    "<YEAR>": number                          // Growth pattern weights by year
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `rls_user_id`: UUID for Row Level Security policies (store manager access control)
- Distribution weights: Control customer and sales allocation across stores
- Order multipliers: Scale order frequency and value by store characteristics
- Year weights: Create realistic business growth patterns over time (2020-2026)

### `reference_data/supplier_data.json` Schema

Defines comprehensive supplier profiles with static contract data for consistent database generation:

```json
{
  "<SUPPLIER_ID>": {
    "supplier_id": number,                    // Sequential supplier ID (1-20)
    "supplier_name": "string",               // Company name
    "supplier_code": "string",               // Standard format: SUP001-SUP020
    "contact_email": "string",               // Primary contact email
    "contact_phone": "string",               // Primary contact phone
    "contracts": [
      {
        "contract_id": number,               // Contract identifier
        "contract_number": "string",         // Format: 2024-XXXX-NNN
        "contract_value": number,            // Contract value (rounded to $10K)
        "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",          // Contract start date
        "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",            // Contract end date (1-2 years)
        "contract_status": "active",         // Contract status
        "payment_terms": "string",           // Payment terms (Net 30/45/60)
        "auto_renew": boolean,               // Auto-renewal flag
        "contract_created": "ISO datetime",  // Creation timestamp
        "renewal_due_soon": boolean,         // Renewal alert flag
        "days_until_expiry": number          // Calculated days to expiry
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Static Data Control**: All supplier information is now static and controlled via JSON instead of random generation
- **Contract Values**: Rounded to nearest $10,000 ranging from $50K to $600K for realistic contract sizes
- **Contract Dates**: End dates range between 1-2 years from current date for realistic contract terms
- **Contract Numbers**: Follow standard format `2024-XXXX-NNN` for consistent naming convention
- **Supplier Codes**: Sequential format `SUP001` through `SUP020` for easy identification
- **Supplier IDs**: Sequential integers 1-20 matching database primary keys
- **Database Consistency**: Generator uses these static values to ensure identical data across database recreations

### Database Connection Configuration

The generator creates a SQLite database file:

- **Database File**: `retail.db` (or custom path)
- **Schema**: All tables in the default SQLite schema
- **Connection**: SQLite file-based, no server required
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with declarative models in `/workspace/app/models/sqlite/`

Configuration can be customized using environment variables or a `.env` file.
